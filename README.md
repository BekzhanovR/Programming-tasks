# Programming Tasks

Solution Programming Problems Compendium These guidelines contain the formulation of 1,000 learning assignments covering everything from scalar types and control operators to compound data structures, recursive algorithms, and pointers.

• Begin — data input and output, assignment operator (40)
• Integer — integers (30)
• Boolean — logical expressions (40)
• If — conditional operator (30)
• Case - selection operator (20)
• For — loop with parameter (40)
• While — loop with condition (30)
• Series — sequences (40)
• Proc — functions (60)
• Minmax — minimum and maximum (30)
• Array — one-dimensional arrays (140)
• Matrix — two-dimensional arrays (100)
• String — symbols and lines (70)
• File — binary files (90)
• Text — text files (60)
• Param — composite data types in procedures and functions (70)
• Recur — recursion (30)
• Dynamic — dynamic data structures (80)

Tasks are focused on the languages ​​traditionally used in the initial programming training: Pascal, С++, Python Basic. At the same time, other languages, such as Javascript or Java, can be used to solve most of the tasks. When formulating tasks, concepts and names specific to a particular programming language are not used.
